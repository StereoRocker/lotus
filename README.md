Lotus OS is a hobbyist OS written for personal use, targetting single core
CPUs (hyperthreading is not supported either).
Mainly being tested on 486s - since I have an abundance of them!

Note:
This OS is not meant to be "better" than other OS's. Its simply made for me to
try and make a functioning micro kernel based OS.
